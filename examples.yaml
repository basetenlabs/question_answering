    - question: Who gave the Statue of Liberty to the USA?
      context: "The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; French: La Liberte eclairant le\n monde) is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor within New York City, in the United\n States. The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, was designed by French\n sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on\n October 28, 1886. The statue is a figure of Libertas, a robed Roman liberty goddess. She holds a torch above her head\n with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed JULY IV MDCCLXXVI (July 4, 1776 in Roman\n numerals), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. A broken shackle and chain lie at her feet as she walks\n forward, commemorating the recent national abolition of slavery.[8] After its dedication, the statue became an icon\n of freedom and of the United States, seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by sea. Bartholdi was inspired\n by a French law professor and politician, Edouard Rene de Laboulaye, who is said to have commented in 1865 that any\n monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and U.S. peoples.  The\n Franco-Prussian War delayed progress until 1875, when Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and\n the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the\n statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions. The\n torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and in Madison Square Park in\n Manhattan from 1876 to 1882. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the\n pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, started a drive for\n donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar.\n The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then\n  called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication\n  ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland.\n\nThe statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War; since\n 1933 it has been maintained by the National Park Service as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, and is a\n major tourist attraction. The monument was temporarily closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially\n reopening that June. Public access to the balcony around the torch has been barred since 1916."
